# HelpTheCity

Help the City is an idea to help others make the places we live better!<br/>
<br/>
It's an open-source application that is being build to be used as a Final Course Work
to obtain the Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at FAI - Centro de Ensino Superior
Em Gestão Tecnologia e Educação, Santa Rita do Sapucaí - Minas Gerais, Brazil.<br/>
<br/>

The main idea is to make an application that can help citizens to report problems with their cities.
Problems like: landslides, water leaks, lighting problems, assault risk areas, areas where many accidents happen,
animals in need of help, fire, flooding, etc.

It will be split into three different applications/modules which will be better explained in a near future.

## Server 
The server is being developed in Javascript using Node.JS.<br/>
It will receive the requests and send responses to the users
based on the application idea. Reports will include photos, descriptions, localizations, etc.

## Mobile
The mobile application will be developed using Phonegap to be compatible with as many devices we can manage.<br/>
The citizen will be able to create reports, providing an image, description and location. It will be possible to rank up
the report to make it more urgent. The user will be able to filter the reports by localization or distance radius.

## Web
The web application will be developed using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.<br/>
This one will be available to any public organization who might want to help. It will have analysis graphical,
user abuses reports and other tools to help the application keep away the reports who aren't real. Also it will be possible
to classify different areas using a map, to take a better look on specific characteristics of each place and give a
wide vision of how to improve it.<br/>


We encourage everyone who might feel excited to help, to feel free to fork and send us improvements!
